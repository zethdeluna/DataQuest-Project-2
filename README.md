# DataQuest-Project-2
Data analysis on Hacker News data. The goal of this project was to find a time during the day at which submitting a post on Hacker News would receive the most comments.  This project is a guided project from DataQuest. With complete honesty, I put my best effort in formulating the code for both the data cleaning and analysis sections before referring to the provided "solution". My goal in completing this project is to improve my skills in data science/analysis. This project was completed on July 9, 2020. â€” Zeth De Luna
